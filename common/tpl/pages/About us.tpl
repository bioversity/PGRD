<h3 id="what-is-the-plant-genetic-resource-diversity-gateway">What is the Plant Genetic Resource Diversity Gateway?</h3>

<p><strong>Plant Genetic Resource Diversity Gateway</strong> is a system that aims to hold trait information and data from crop wild relatives and landraces. It connects and brings together national inventories, checklists, national conservation strategies, phenotypic and genomic data. This system is being developed and hosted by Bioversity International. It can act also as a communication and information tool for implementing strategies for crop wild relatives and landraces genetic resources.</p>

<p>The gateway provides the user with a searchable database of related information, links and communication channel for plant genetic resources. It provides countries and institutions with a means to coordinate the management of their national data and access to them. </p>

<p><strong>The Plant Genetic Resource Diversity Gateway</strong> has been carried out within the framework of the PGR Secure project (www.pgrsecure.org), which is the short name of a collaborative project funded under the EU Seventh Framework Programme, THEME KBBE.2010.1.1-03, ‘Characterization of biodiversity resources for wild crop relatives to improve crops by breeding’, Grant agreement no. 266394.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-the-plant-genetic-resource-diversity-gateway-currently-contain">What does the Plant Genetic Resource Diversity Gateway currently contain?</h3>

<p>Currently the portal is populated with data from EURISCO, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the System-wide Information Network for Genetic Resources (SINGER, now closed) and EUFGIS (European  <br>
Information System on Forest Genetic Resources).  Data generated from the project have been uploaded and more data will be loaded as they become available.</p>

<h3 id="objectives-of-the-plant-genetic-resource-diversity-gateway">Objectives of the Plant Genetic Resource Diversity Gateway</h3>

<p>The objectives of the <strong>Gateway</strong> and the network as a whole are to: <br>
 - help institutions, national and international agencies, NGOs, training and research groups throughout the world to share data on crop wild relatives and landraces and coordinate their efforts on policy and management <br>
 - achieve better management, conservation and use of all crop wild relatives and landraces genetic resources for better and more sustainable agricultural production of food in all countries, in accordance with the <a href="http://www.fao.org/monitoringprogress/summit_en.html">World Food Summit Plan of Action</a>, the <a href="http://www.planttreaty.org">International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture</a> and the <a href="http://www.biodiv.org">UN Convention on Biological Diversity</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Plant Genetic Resource Diversity Gateway</strong> offers (at the moment): <br>
 - a means to maintain, share and access information and data <br>
 - an advanced communication and information tool to facilitate countries reporting and policymaking decisions <br>
 - an infrastructure for storing and linking data on crop wild relatives, landraces, traits, QTL, evaluation data, environmental data, inventories, checklists and conservation strategies (more to come) <br>
 - a central point for country, regional and global contacts on crop wild relative and landrace information</p>

<h3 id="structure-of-the-network">Structure of the network</h3>

<p>This network is key to the communication and information-related aspects of crop wild relatives and landraces genetic resources, and serves as the virtual structure for national inventories and conservation strategies. The network facilitates the coordination of country, regional and global efforts on crop wild relatives and landraces genetic resources, while at the same time allowing greater scope for national or regional specificities in the management and dissemination of information.</p>

<p><strong>Plant Genetic Resource Diversity Gateway</strong> is the center of a network of standalone information systems. The network aims to link in situ and on-farm regional information systems and national information systems in individual countries to the Plant <strong>Genetic Resource Diversity Gateway</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-provide-information-to-the-system">How can I provide information to the system?</h3>

<p>This network treats institutions as the smallest unit, and accepts aggregation at regional and worldwide levels. To this effect, the network will enable institutes, country, regional and the global information systems to share data. Institutes can update their datasets, and any user can view information. </p>
