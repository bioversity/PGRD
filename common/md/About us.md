### What is the Plant Genetic Resource Diversity Gateway?

The Plant Genetic Resources Diversity Gateway aims to promote and facilitate the use of crop wild relatives and landraces in breeding and crop improvement by providing traits and QTL information of potential value to breeders and other users of germplasm. It also provides information on checklists, inventories and conservation strategies of crop wild relatives and land races at national level and regional levels of use to conservation managers, scientists and policymakers.

The Plant Genetic Resources Diversity Gateway  started as a product of a project known as 'PGR Secure'.  This collaborative project, with the full name 'Novel characterization of crop wild relative and landrace resources as a basis for improved crop breeding' was funded under the EU Seventh Framework Programme THEME KBBE.2010.1.1-03 on 'Characterization of biodiversity resources for wild crop relatives to improve crops by breeding'.

The gateway provides countries and institutions with a means to coordinate and disseminate information on their national data.

### What standards are used to describe the data?

* The data from _ex situ_ resources use the FAO/IPGRI Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors ([MCPD](http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/faoipgri-multi-crop-passport-descriptors-mcpd/)) format used generically for genebank information and documentation
* On-farm data uses the '[Descriptors for Web-Enabled National In Situ Landrace Inventories](http://www.pgrsecure.bham.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/helpdesk/LRDESCRIPTORS_PGRSECURE.pdf)'
* The _in situ_ CWR national checklists, national inventories and conservation strategies use the following 'STANDARD for National Checklists, National Inventories and Conservation Strategies, v1 and 'Standards for QTL' (soon available).

These include information at the provider, institution and taxon level and checklist types. They provide a structure to describe in detail the various components: identification of countries/institutes, crossability, threatened status, taxon, population, accession, site and location in which the population was collected or is monitored, and institute or individual monitoring. In addition, there is also a data standards publication for documenting information on Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL), which includes: data provider information, marker identifiers, trait names, sequence homology, crossability and taxon.

Examples of common fields are:

* **Taxonomy**: Family, Subfamily, Genus, Species, Scientific name, Common taxon names
* **Location**: Country, Primary administrative unit, Secondary administrative unit, Lowest administrative unit, Elevation, Minimum elevation, Maximum elevation
* **Forest gene conservation units**: Population status, Origin of the material, Predominant silvicultural system, Population management, Population justification, Population reproducing trees, Sex ratio, Status of long-term viable regeneration, Distribution of the reproducing trees in the unit
* **Accessions**: Holding institute code, Accession number, Accession names, Collecting/acquisition source, Biological status, Donor institute, Donor accession number, AEGIS status, Availability
* **Crop wild relatives**: Endemism, Chromosome number, Gene pool, Taxon group, List of species crosses, Red List assessment level, Region of assessment
* **Checklist**: Type of checklist
* **Inventory**: Nnational inventory, List of criteria used for NI prioritization, Country of assessment

### What does the Plant Genetic Resources Diversity Gateway currently contain?

Currently the portal is populated with accession, checklist, national inventory, conservation strategy data, and forestry unit data. The current information available in the system comes from pre-existing _ex situ_ resources and _in situ_ and on-farm information produced during the project.

The data shared through the Plant Genetic Resources Diversity Gateway are based on standards developed in the project to meet data-sharing needs. The standards and respective templates for data collation are available for data providers.

* Standards for national checklist
* Standards for national inventory
* Standard and methodology for conservation strategy
* Standards for Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL)
* [Descriptors for Web-Enabled National _In Situ_ Landrace Inventories](http://www.pgrsecure.bham.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/helpdesk/LRDESCRIPTORS_PGRSECURE.pdf)
* FAO/IPGRI Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors list [MCPD](http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/faoipgri-multi-crop-passport-descriptors-mcpd/)

### Objectives of the Plant Genetic Resources Diversity Gateway

The objectives of the Plant Genetic Resources Diversity Gateway are to:

* Help institutions, national and international agencies, NGOs, training and research groups throughout the world to share data on crop wild relatives and landraces and coordinate their efforts for better policy, management and facilitated use
* Achieve better management, conservation and use of all crop wild relative and landrace genetic resources for better and more sustainable agricultural production of food in all countries, in accordance with the [World Food Summit Plan of Action](http://www.fao.org/monitoringprogress/summit_en.html), the [International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture](http://www.planttreaty.org) and the [UN Convention on Biological Diversity](http://www.biodiv.org)
* Offer plant breeders more and better information on traits, crop wild relatives and landraces.

**Plant Genetic Resources Diversity Gateway** offers:

* A ready-to-use platform with a portal and visualization map service
* A means to maintain, share and access information and data
* An advanced communication and information tool to facilitate country reporting and policymaking decisions
* An infrastructure for storing and linking data on crop wild relatives, landraces, traits, QTL, evaluation data, environmental data, inventories, checklists and conservation strategies A central point for country, regional and global contacts on crop wild relative and landrace information

### How can I provide information to the system?

This system treats institutions as the smallest unit, and accepts aggregation at regional and worldwide levels. To this effect, the system will enable institutes, country, regional and global information systems to share data. Institutes can update their datasets, and any user can view information. You can provide your information using the standards and templates for data gathering.

Should you be interested in providing data or updating your data, [contact us](mailto:s.dias@cgiar.org?subject=HPDESk-PGRDiversity%20Gateway-Uploading-updating%20data%20).
